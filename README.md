Navi - A declarative navigation framework for Flutter, based on Navigator 2.0.

If you love Flutter, you would love [declarative UI](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/flutter-for/declarative) and
therefore **declarative navigation**.

**Navigator 2.0** provides a declarative navigation API. Unfortunately, it's **too complex and difficult to use** with a
lot of **boilerplate**. Not only that, it requires to keep a **single state** to manage the whole navigation system of
your application. It's not a good architecture, and definitely **does not fit in large scale applications**.

**Navi** helps you keep all the powerful of Navigator 2.0 but with a **simple and easy to learn API**. It helps you
manage your navigation system in **split and isolated domains**.

Note that, **imperative navigation API is also supported** as an extra layer beyond the declarative API.
